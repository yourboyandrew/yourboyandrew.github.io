            <h2>My High School of Choice</h2>
            <p>Once I am finally out of Bancroft I want to go to Lakewood High School. I like this school a lot because all of my freinds are going to it and my brother Kevin went to Lakewood.
                Another reason I want to go to lakewood is that the school has good electives, when I go to lakewood I want to have a zero period and I will be able to have two electives.
                When you take a zero period it adds to your credits, now you don't have to take as many classes in your senior year.
                This excites me because it will allow me to enjoy senior year more because I have more freedom.</p>

            <h2>My College of Choice</h2>
            <p>I haven’t really looked into any colleges, but I really want to go to a music college because I want to go into the music industry playing the guitar and singing.
                Music helped me in a lot of ways growing up, it reduced all of the anxiety and I want to do the same for other people.
                I'm also gonna be able to make a lot of people that also share the same interests as me, which will end up helping me in the end.
                I want to meet people that have the same music interest as me because, I will almost certainly go nowhere if I don't like what I'm playing.     
            </p>

        <h2>Career Interests of Mine</h2>
        <p>
                Some feature career interests for me are going into the music industry because in a lot of ways music has helped me, and I want to create music because it seems interesting.
                 I’m also interested in becoming a lawyer because I think I am good at arguing for someone, and it seems like a lot of fun. 
                 Creating and Making music for me sounds like a lot of fun because I get to do what I love, and I get to work with all of my friends almost on the daily.
                 Music is one of the most important things to me because it helps some people through some tough times, calms people down and it gives you something to do when you are board, all of that sounds very motivating to me.

        <h2>Some Goals of Mine</h2>
        <p>When I'm an adult I want to many things for example I want to own one of Kurt Cobain's guitars, finish college and, have a big family.
            I want to own one of Kurt Cobain's guitars because it would be cool to own something that my idol used almost on a daily basis.
            When I am finally out of highschool I want to go to a music college, I don't know what degree I want but I know one thing for sure, I want at least a master's degree.
            And finally I want a big family because my family means so much to me and, I think it would be fun to have kids (probably 4 so each one has at least 1 buddy).
