        <h1>Music</h1>
            <h2>What is Music</h2>
            <p>Music is a form of art that expresses a thoughts or emotions through rythm, harmony, melody and using instruments or vocals. 
                Music is used to express your emotion torwards a subject, make people happy or they just do it for fun. Regardless the reason someone creates music,
                it will always be changing someones life one way or another.</p>
            <h2>Three of My Favorite Bands</h2>
           <h3>Nirvana</h3>
            <p>This band was made up of Kurt Cobain (vocals and lead guitarist), Krist Noveselic (bassist), Pat Smear (rhythm guitarist), and five different drummers most notably Dave Grohl.
            Nirvana went through multiple names for example there was Ted Ed Fred, Fecal Matter, Skid Row, etc. 2 Years After their formation they released their first album "Bleach",
            they were officially a part of the grunge scene after its release. But then their popularity increased dramatically when they released "Nevermind", this album  included songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit,
            Breed and, Inbloom. this album hit number one on the billboard album charts. They then released their third album "In Utero" this album took a whole new sound, it included songs like Heart Shaped Box, Serve the Servants and, All Apologies.
            But sadly the band came to a halt when the lead singer commited suicide, this marked the end of Nirvana. All though the band has ended it still has a remaining impact on music nowadays.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am intereseted in a lot of stuff, for example I am interested in getting better on the guitar.
            I am interested in that because music means a lot to me because it helped me a lot when I was younger.
            Another thing that I am interested in is learning how to code, I am interested in this because the future is technology and this is giving me a head start.
            I am interested in going to Lakewood High School because my brother went to that school and a lot of my freinds

         
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Some stuff that I like doing in my free time are playing the guitar, watching tv or listening to music.
            I like playing the guitar because it is very relaxing and it gives me something to do when I am bored.
            I I like watch TV because you can almost never get bored of it since there is almost an infinite number of things to watch.
            Finally, I listen to music almost for the same reason I play the guitar, it relaxes me and it's just a fun thing to do.
