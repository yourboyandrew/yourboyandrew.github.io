        <h1>Music</h1>
            <h2>What is Music</h2>
            <p>Music is a form of art that expresses a thoughts or emotions through rythm, harmony, melody and using instruments or vocals. 
                Music is used to express your emotion torwards a subject, make people happy or they just do it for fun. Regardless the reason someone creates music,
                it will always be changing someones life one way or another.</p>
            <h2>Three of My Favorite Bands</h2>
           <h3>Nirvana</h3>
            <p>This band was made up of Kurt Cobain (vocals and lead guitarist), Krist Noveselic (bassist), Pat Smear (rhythm guitarist), and five different drummers most notably Dave Grohl.
            Nirvana was initually formed when Kurt Cobain was introduced to Krist Noveselic by Krist's younger brother, little did they know they would become one of the most iconic bands in the history of music.
            Nirvana went through multiple names for example there was Ted Ed Fred, Fecal Matter, Skid Row, etc. 2 Years After their formation they released their first album "Bleach",
            they were officially a part of the grunge scene after its release. But then their popularity increased dramatically when they released "Nevermind", this album  included songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit,
            Breed and, Inbloom. This album hit number one on the billboard album charts. They then released their third album "In Utero" this album took a whole new sound, it included songs like Heart Shaped Box, Serve the Servants and, All Apologies.
            But sadly the band came to a halt when the lead singer commited suicide, this marked the end of Nirvana. All though the band has ended it still has a remaining impact on music nowadays. This band is one of my favorites because their musc helped me with stress and is always my go to band to listen to.</p>

        <h3>Weezer</h3>
        <p>This band is made up of Rivers Cuomo (vocals and guitarist), Brian Bell(guitarist), Scott Shriner (bassist) and, Patrick Wilson(drummer).
            Weezer sign a deal with Geffen Records in 1993 and released three singles, Undone-The Sweater Song, Buddy Holly and, Say it Ain't So, all of these songs had positive reception.
            They released their debut album "The Blue Album", this album is a certified triple platinum in the United States and, it is a double platinum in Canada (you must sell over a million copies of the album).
            But their second album "Pinkerton" didn't recieve very good reviews, this deeply affected Rivers since the writing of the songs were based on his struggles in life and, he was also going through a dark time in his life during the writing and release of the album.
            Since Pinkerton, they have released a total nine albums, their songs Beverly Hills, Perfect Situation and, This Is Such a Pity (came off of the "Make Believe" album) made it to the top ten of the Billboard Modern Rock chart.
            Since then the band hasn't made any notable successes, nevertheless they are still once of my favorite bands.
