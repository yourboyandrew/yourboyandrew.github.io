        <h1>About ATM</h1>
            <p>ATM is the elective that teaches middle-schoolers almost everthing about computers.
	ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet, it is a 3 year commitment. The program will range from typing to 3D printing, 
		    and it is probably one of the best programs to get into</p>

	<h1>Reflection</h1>
	<p> I believe ATM is the best elective because it is giving you a boost into the future because our future is going to be nothing but computers. 
		It also opens up a bunch career opportunities because not very many people nowadays know anything about technology. 
		Overall it is just a really fun program because you get to 3D print and use computers. It makes students use their brains because
	you have to memorize a bunch of codes and it will hel work on your thinking skill. The ATM program is a great elective and I would recomend it to everyone.</p>
