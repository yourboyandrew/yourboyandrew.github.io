            <h2>Some of My Skills</h2>
            <p>I'm pretty good at playing the guitar, I mainly know Nirvana songs on the guitar because they are my favorite band.
                I have played the guitar for around 4 years, I hate playing it in front of my family because I don't like getting all the attention from them.
                I feel as though I am decent at playing the guitar, I am not skilled but I am not bad at it either. I am skilled at playing games (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 or Black Ops 3), those are my most played games because I have played them since I was young.
                At my home I have a small farm but the only thing is, I grow pumpkins and zucchini

	<h1>Reflection</h1>
	<p> I believe ATM is the best elective because it is giving you a boost into the future because our future is going to be nothing but computers. 
		It also opens up a bunch career opportunities because not very many people nowadays know anything about technology. 
		Overall it is just a really fun program because you get to 3D print and use computers. It makes students use their brains because
	you have to memorize a bunch of codes and it will hel work on your thinking skill. The ATM program is a great elective and I would recomend it to everyone.</p>
