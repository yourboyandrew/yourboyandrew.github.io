        <h2>About ATM</h2>
            <p>ATM is the elective that teaches middle-schoolers almost everthing about computers.
	ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet, it is a 3 year commitment. The program will range from typing to 3D printing, 
		    and it is probably one of the best programs to get into</p>

	<h2>Some Of My Work</h2>
	<h3>Typing Test</h3>
	<p>This is my typing test from 6th grade, this test is to show our growth in typing and since 6th grade I have definitely increased.
	I have increased my typing speed since 6th grade (which is currently 60WPM), but nevertheless there is always room for improvement.</p>

	<h3>SketchUp Apartment</h3>
	<p>During 7th grade we used a lot of programs, but none were nearly as fun as SketchUp, in this program we are able to create 3D models of almost anything you can imagine.
	This project had me and my group create an apartment, each person was in incharge of different piece of furniture and these pieces would create our apartment.</p>

	<h3>My Cat Website</h3>
	<p>We created our first website but didn't actually publish it onto the interent. We were able to choose one of 2 themes, cats or dogs.
	I chose cats (as you can see by the heading), we had to choose a color scheme, insert a video and images, and we had to write about cats or dogs</p>

	<h3>My Video</h3>
		   <p>This is the video I made during my first semester of 8th grade ATM. We had to do our video on an important topic that either affects our community or the earth.
		    My subject was obesity, it was a community goal because obesity is a real issue within America. It affects too many adults and children, that is why I chose it.</p>

	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p> I believe ATM is the best elective because it is giving you a boost into the future because our future is going to be nothing but computers. 
	It also opens up a bunch career opportunities because not very many people nowadays know anything about technology. 
	Overall it is just a really fun program because you get to 3D print and use computers. It makes students use their brains because
	you have to memorize a bunch of codes and it will work on your thinking skills. The ATM program is a great elective and I would recomend it to everyone.</p>
